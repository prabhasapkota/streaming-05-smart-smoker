# Module 6: streaming-05-smart-smoker

## Objectives: 
 * We'll look at implementing analytics for a "smart smoker" (as in slow cooked food).
 * We'll understand the process, design our system, and implement the producer. 

## Requirements:
* RabbitMQ Server running
* Pika installed in .venv
* Use Module 4 projects as examples

## Task 1: Create a place to work
* In GitHub, create a new repo for your project - name it * *
* Add a README.md during the creation process. (If not, you can always add it later.)
* Clone your repo down to your machine. 
* In VS Code,add a .gitignore (use one from an earlier module), start working on the README.md Create it if you didn't earlier.
* Add the csv data file to your repo. 
* Create a file for your bbq producer.

## Task 2: Design and Implement your producer
* Implement your bbq producer. 
* Use the logic, approach, and structure from Module 4, version 2 and version 3.
* These provide a current and solid foundation for streaming analytics - modifying them to serve your purpose IS part of the assignment.
* Do not start from scratch - do not search for code - do not use a notebook.
* Use comments in the code and repo to explain your work. 
* Use docstring comments and add your name and date to your README and your code files. 
* Explain your project in the README. Include prerequisites and how to run your code. 
* Document your project works - display screenshots of your console and maybe the RabbitMQ console. 
* If you only have a producer, you won't have a consumer showing messages yet, so you'll need to be creative. We'll build the consumers next.
